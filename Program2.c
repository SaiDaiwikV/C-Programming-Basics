// In previous Programe1 we have learnt what is the syntax and how to rnn the code 

// Let us start with course with some deeper knowledge

// Step-1 : Import Header files;

#include<stdio.h>

// Start with the main function : 

int main()
{
    // using of multiple printf functions in the main function;

    printf("Hello\n");

    // '\n' is used because when we use next printf both will print seprate lines;
    // if do not use '\n' both the printed lines will come in the same line in the output without any space;

    printf("My name is V.Sai Daiwik\n");

    printf("Presently I am styding at LPU\n");

    return 0;

    // return 0 is an optional thing without using it program will run without any error;
