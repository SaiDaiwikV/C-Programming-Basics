// In this program we learn : 'What is the Syntax of the C-programming and How does it Works'.

// First we want to import basic libraries to run the simple C-program.

// To import we will use '#include<lib.h>' line.

// Program starts : 

#include<stdio.h>

// The above line indicates that we have successfully imported 'stdio.h' library. But we want know that is called 'stdio' it means that stdio stands for 'Standard input and output'.

int main()
// int main is the function where we write the code. we required minimum of one function in C to run the code;
{
    //  to enter the int main we use '{}';

    printf("Hello, World");

    // printf() is used to print the value what we written in the double dots on the output screen;

    // Do not forgot to keep semi-colon at the end of the programe if not then it shows an error;

    // As we want to become a good programer to we want to use 'return 0' in the end of the program;

    return 0;

    // This is will help in exiting of the program after compleing all the line of the code;
}

// use the VS-CODE to write the programes and create a seperate folder to save all the codes which will help for referrence;

// Congrats you have successfully completed your first C-program;
